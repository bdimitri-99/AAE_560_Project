# AAE_560_Project
Relevant RPO files for AAE 560 Final Project

The MATLAB file included reads data from the RPO excel spreadsheets, and then runs the RPO algorithms (not included in the Repo). The main purpose of the MATLAB script is to call the RPO program and then interpret the data and generate output plots. With the MATLAB script, the SoS capability index can be selected, as can the cost range to use in RPO. The outputs of the MATLAB script are normalized against the baseline case.
